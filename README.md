### A portal where recovered COVID-19 patients can share their resources.

<p>
  Making a donation is the ultimate sign of solidarity. So here we are Team Sadbhawna launching our Web-Portal SADBHAWNA where recovered COVID-19 patients can donate any     medicines, supplements etc. can be helpful to others in need.
</p>

We make a heartful request for everyone to please come forward and contribute here. Your contribution in a small way may help many in their battle against COVID-19.

#### Note - Please consult a doctor before using any shared resource(s). Team Sadbhawna won't take any responsibilty as the portal is open for all.
